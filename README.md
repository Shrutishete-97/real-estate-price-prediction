# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction & Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Mumbai real estate data and building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on key property features.

The project covers the complete data analytics lifecycle — from data cleaning and analysis to machine learning, visualization, and deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze real estate price trends in Mumbai
- Understand the impact of features like BHK, area, and locality on prices
- Build a regression model to predict house prices
- Visualize insights using Power BI
- Deploy the ML model using Streamlit

---

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset contains property-level information including:
- BHK
- Area (sqft)
- Locality
- Region
- Property Type
- Property Status
- Property Age
- Price (Target Variable)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Power BI**
- **Streamlit**
- **VS Code**
- **Git & GitHub**

---

## 🔍 Data Processing
- Removed duplicate records
- Checked and handled missing values
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Applied feature engineering using one-hot encoding
- Log transformation applied to target variable to handle skewness

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Type**: Supervised Learning (Regression)
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% / 20%
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - R² Score ≈ 0.82
  - Mean Absolute Error ≈ 43 Lakhs

The model was tested on unseen data and used to predict prices for new property inputs.

---

## 📊 Visualization
An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was created to:
- Show average, minimum, and maximum prices
- Analyze price trends by locality and BHK
- Visualize feature impact on pricing
- Compare actual vs predicted prices

---

## 🚀 Deployment
The trained machine learning model was deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to enter property details and receive real-time price predictions through a web interface.

---

## 📌 Key Learnings
- End-to-end data analytics workflow
- Feature engineering and regression modeling
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Dashboard creation for business insights
- Model deployment using Streamlit
- Version control using GitHub

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Integrate SQL database for data storage
- Enhance Streamlit UI and deploy online
